# SimplyHired API Library

## Overview

Simply Hired library aims at making it easy to add job listings to your website using simply PHP objects and method calls. The library supports both the XML and JSON API's.

This is an initial port from the [Drupal module](https://drupal.org/project/simply_hired_job_a_matic) and [Wordpress plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/sh-jobamatic/) code to form a single library that can be used across multiple projects without maintaining duplicate code. The code is not well documented at this point but will be improving over time. However, the library uses very well documented design patterns and a documented API, so it is not the difficult to use in the short term.

## Versions

 The Simply Hired PHP library has been split into two branches; 1.x and 2.x. The [1.x branch](https://github.com/r0nn1ef/simplyhired/tree/master/1.x) is for the __soon to be retired__ Job-a-matic&trade; API and the [2.x branch](https://github.com/r0nn1ef/simplyhired/tree/2.x) is for the new [Simply Hired Partner Solutions](http://www.simplypartner.com) service and each requires it's own set of API credentials.
